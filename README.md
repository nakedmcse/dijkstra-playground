# dijkstra-playground
A react app for playing with a maze path tracing implementation of dijkstras algorithm.

## Overview

An efficient implementation of dijkstras algorithm, which is bound to a map which gets updated with the path after tracing.
Costs for each of the cardinal direcctions can be set.

## Features

- **Settable Costs** for each of the directions
- **Min Heap Priority Queue** implementation of dijkstras algorithm

## Usage

To build:

```bash
    npm run build
```

To run locally for dev:

```bash
    npm run start
```
