# dijkstra-playground
A react app for playing with a maze path tracing implementation of dijkstras algorithm.

## Overview

An efficient implementation of dijkstras algorithm, which is bound to a map which gets updated with the path after tracing.
Costs for each of the cardinal direcctions can be set.  It can be set to show just the winning path, or all explored paths.
Multiple maze generation algorithms are included.

## Features

- **Settable Costs** for each of the directions
- **Min Heap Priority Queue** implementation of dijkstras algorithm
- **Stack DFS** implementation of maze generation algorithm
- **Entombed** implementation of maze generation algorithm
- **Information Modal** showing the dijkstra algorithm

## Usage

To build:

```bash
    npm run build
```

To run locally for dev:

```bash
    npm run start
```
